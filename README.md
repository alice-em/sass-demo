# Sassy Style Sheets

## What, huh?
- `sass` is a slighty different css syntax
- `sass` needs to be compiled to be rendered by browsers
- By needing to be compiled, you can use variables, functions, and more!

## Wait, but why?!
- `sass` offers a way to help organize your css
- Variables can ensure that colors and text are uniform
- It also means that changing a color only needs to take place in 1 line

## That's kinda cool! How do I get this amazing piece of software?
- The internet!
- You'll need `ruby`, which comes of `OSX` by default.
  - If you're using Windows or Linux (Cool!): refer to [this](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- `gem install sass`
- If that doesn't work... `sudo` it!
- `sudo gem install sass`

## Wow! That's easy, now how do I use it?
- `sass scss css`
- `sass style.dev.scss style.css`
- `sass --watch style.dev.scss style.css`
