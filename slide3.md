## That's kinda cool! How do I get this amazing piece of software?
- The internet!
- You'll need `ruby`, which comes of `OSX` by default.
  - If you're using Windows or Linux (Cool!): refer to [this](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- `gem install sass`
- If that doesn't work... `sudo` it!
- `sudo gem install sass`
